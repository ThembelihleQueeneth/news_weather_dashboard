# Asynchronous Programming Demo

A comprehensive TypeScript project demonstrating different asynchronous programming patterns: Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await.

## Features

- Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Fetch news headlines from DummyJSON API
- Three implementations of the same functionality:
  - Callback-based (with callback hell demonstration)
  - Promise-based (with Promise.all and Promise.race)
  - Async/Await (with proper error handling)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
